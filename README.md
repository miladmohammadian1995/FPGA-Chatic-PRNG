Project Description & Reconstruction Guide

This project follows a three-stage design flow, starting with algorithm development in HLS, moving to RTL-level verification, and finally integrating into a complete Zynq-based system.

1. 1_HLS_Source/ — PRNG Core Design in C++ with Vivado HLS
Contains C++ source code for the chaos-based PRNG algorithm, HLS synthesis & cosimulation report images, and a C++ testbench for software-level verification.

Reconstruction:
1. Open Vivado HLS and create a new project.
2. Add files from src/ and tb/.
3. Run C Simulation, C Synthesis, and Cosimulation.
4. Once verified, Export RTL for the next stage.

2. 2_RTL_Verification/ — RTL Simulation in Vivado
Contains Verilog RTL generated from HLS, AXI control logic, waveform images from Vivado behavioral simulation, and a Verilog testbench to verify signal behavior (TVALID, TLAST, etc.).

Reconstruction:
1. Open Vivado and create a new RTL project.
2. Add src/ files as Design Sources and tb/test_bench.v as a Simulation Source.
3. Run Behavioral Simulation and compare results with images in images/.

3. 3_System_Integration/ — Zynq-Based System Integration
Includes the Vivado block design (.bd), system diagram images, post-implementation summary, and the IP repository containing the packaged PRNG IP from Vivado HLS for reuse.

Reconstruction:
1. Open Vivado and create a new Zynq project.
2. Add the ip_repo/ path in Settings → IP → Repository to make the custom IP available.
3. Import design_L1.bd from block_design/.
4. Regenerate the block design and run Synthesis and Implementation.

4. reports/ — Final Reports
Contains post-route timing analysis, FPGA resource utilization, and the HLS synthesis report for the PRNG core.
These can be used to validate design performance against your own results.

Note:
The project has been fully designed, synthesized, and simulated, but on-board testing was not performed due to the absence of physical FPGA hardware.
